Part A) Implement complete autograd framework in python 
and numpy  and mnist classifier using the autograd framework.
Implemented:
autograd in python, numpy

Extra points : If you implement a new activation function, 
new optimizer and new loss function in this code.

Added softmax, cross entropy loss

Part B)  Build an CNN based image classifier (at least 3 - 5 categories) 
Implemented:
Fashion MNIST in both keras, pytorch

Extra points : If you create your own pooling layer

Added pooling layer, rmsprop optimizer, loss, patience, stride, momemtum,
tensorboard integration
