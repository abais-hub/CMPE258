# CMPE 258, HW 3 Abhishek Bais

Generated data: 
- 3d input, 2d output

Extra points:
- 3d space visualization of data is shown for both outputs

Part A
- Used pure Numpy to build a 3 layer neural network with linear layers and with relu nonlinearity

Part B1
- Used pure pytorch tensor datastructure to build a 3 layer neural network with linear layers and with relu nonlinearity

Part B2
- Used pure pytorch tensor datastructure to build a 3 layer neural network with linear layers and with relu nonlinearity & auto differentiation

Part B3
- Used pure pytorch tensor high level primitives to build a 3 layer neural network with linear layers and with relu nonlinearity

Part C1
- Used pure tensorflow datastructure to build a 3 layer neural network with linear layers and with relu nonlinearity

Part C2
- Used pure tensorflow datastructure to build a 3 layer neural network with linear layers and with relu nonlinearity & auto differentiation

Part C3
- Used pure tensforflow high level primitives to build a 3 layer neural network with linear layers and with relu nonlinearity
