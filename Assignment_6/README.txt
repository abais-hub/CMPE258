Part A) Implement complete autograd framework in python 
and numpy  and mnist classifier using the autograd framework.
Built:
autograd in python, numpy

Extra points : If you implement a new activation function, 
new optimizer and new loss function in this code.

Part B)  Build an CNN based image classifier (at least 3 - 5 categories) 
Implemented:
Fashion MNIST in both keras, pytorch

Extra points : If you create your own pooling layer
Added pooling layer
Used:
Different optimizer, loss, patience, stride, momemtum,
tensorboard integration

Part C) Extra credit 
Transfer learning with keras and pytorch using pretrained models

Implemented Fashion MNIST with transfer learing using
both keras and pytorch
